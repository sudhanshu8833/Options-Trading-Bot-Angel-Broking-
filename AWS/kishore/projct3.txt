Hi, I have a simple strategy to develop into algorithm for the NSE (Indian Stock Market) for positional trades. Strategy is mentioned below: update regularly manually 2 months of highest high Buy trade : I take buy trade when the stock prise is fall down -20% from 2 months highest price. For example stock is “ABC” and its 2months high is 100 then if stock comes down at 80 (-20% of 2 months highest prise) then I take buy trade. I book profit at 5% up.  This strategy is I want to develop into Algorithm.  Autobuy after 20% falling on 2 months highest prise and profit should book (auto book)on 5% up from my buying prise.  Investment will be same on each trade (around 10k or editable).  Currently i have 500 stocks and I want to add till1000 stocks and stock list should be edible so I can add remove stocks.  I am looking a developer to create autotrading as per my strategy.  Thanks
